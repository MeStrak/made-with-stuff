  <h3 align="center">Made With Stuff</h3>

Made with stuff is a fun component to add a **made with ‚ù§ by me** with a randomly selected emoji to your website. Build with Vue.js, works with React using Vuera.

Some examples:

    Made with üëç by Strak.
    Made with üíö by me.
    Made with üçï + ‚òï by our awesome team.
    Built by Little One, fuelled by ‚òï.


### Built With

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
* [Twemoji-amazimg](https://github.com/SebastianAigner/twemoji-amazing)


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Install the component in your project.


```sh
yarn add @strak/made-with-stuff
```
or
```sh
npm install @strak/made-with-stuff
```

Then add it to the pages or components where you want to display it. Font style, etc. will be inherited from your existing css.

Set *beforetext* and *aftertext* props to configure the text. If they are not configured the component will display **Made with ‚ù§ by me** (with random emoji).

Set *:maxemojis* to display more than one emoji, like this: **Made with ‚ù§ + üëç by me**.

Set *:maxemojis* to an integer from 1-5 to adjust the size of the emojis (1 is smallest).

```html
<template>
  <span>
    <MadeWithStuff beforetext="Made with" aftertext="by us!" :maxemojis="3" :emojisize="1"></MadeWithStuffVue>
  </span>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import MadeWithStuff from "@strak/made-with-stuff";
export default {
  components: {
    MadeWithStuff
  }
};
</script>
```
